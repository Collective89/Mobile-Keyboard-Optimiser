MOBILE KEYBOARD OPTIMISER VERSION 1.7

BACKGROUND
The invention relates to the field of Human Computer Interaction, specifically virtual keyboard implementation for a text messaging system on smartphones, tablets and PCs.

DESCRIPTION
In recent years the precedence of smart phones and tablets being used both as entertainment and communications devices has increased dramatically. In tandem with this increase in usage there has also been understandably 
an increase in the number of programs being created for, sold and run on smartphones and tablets. The Internet and the creation of online stores has aided in this expansion of software availability for computing devices and 
as a tool which has become integrated in everyday life. Many of these applications which have been created specifically for smart phones and tablets utilise in some form a text entry system whether that application be for 
communication purposes such as text messaging, Internet and email messaging, and social media applications, or for leisure purposes such as restaurant locators or maps and GPS systems.
Due to the fact that tablets and smartphones cannot utilise a traditional QWERTY keyboard as it would defeat the raison dâ€™etre of smart phones and tablets which is that they are portable, they must make use of virtual 
keyboards either as part of the operating system on which the applications and the device is are managed or embedded as part of the applications installed on the devices themselves. It was noticed that the keyboards 
utilised in the applications in their virtual form still have the layout of that of our QWERTY keyboard. QWERTY keyboards were originally designed for typists who were wireless operators sending messages around the 
planet in the 19th century. The design of QWERTY keyboards is optimised in such a way that all five digits of both hands can type messages most efficiently as letters which are commonly situated next to each other 
in words are also situated next to each other QWERTY words.

However this design is redundant for virtual keyboards used in applications on mobile devices as people generally use a single digit to enter text using virtual keyboards and mobile devices and the most two 
digits i.e. Both thumbs to type text messages and text using these virtual keyboards. It becomes apparent therefore that traditional QWERTY keyboard designs are not suited to the single digit letter entry that is 
practised on virtual keyboards on mobile devices and that a new virtual keyboard layout design must be sought in order to allow for the entry of text optimally on mobile devices where the user is entering the text using a single digit.
